# ExcelJS

This is a frontend test task implemented as a part of the evaluation process.

The original spec (written in Russian) can be seen [here](https://gist.github.com/C-Pro/3ad045134ef8c98e4771c42605b55942).

The scripts here implement a very basic Excel functionality. There are some unit tests written to cover the essential logic.
